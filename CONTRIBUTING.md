# Contribution Guideline

First, look for similar issues or requests in the `Issues` tab. If there isn't then,

Create an issue or a new feature request in the `Issues` tab for your bug or requirement. I will try to implement it as soon as possible or wait for the community to respond, or you can share the created issue with someone who might be able to fix or add it.

If you are looking to solve some of the created issues, please `fork` the repo and write a clear solution for the issue and then create a pull request to be reviewed and merged.
